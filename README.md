# Patient-Readmission-Risk-Prediction-with-MLP-and-KAN
This project focuses on predicting patient readmission risk using two distinct neural network architectures: the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the novel Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). The project aims to compare the performance of these architectures in terms of accuracy and interpretability on a medical dataset.
